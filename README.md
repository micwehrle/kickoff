# kickoff
Boilerplate 2015-09


Todo:  
- configure eslint


For me, I don't want to keep up with _all_ the new and crazy frameworks all the time.
I like something I can come back to, a toolchain that does not change all that often and
that I can rely on and that provides me with what I usually need in a project.

# Toolchain

## gulp, browserify
